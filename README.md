### Overview

This is a website that lets you revise the Holy Quran whenever there is no one around to help you.

I often found myself in need of revising the Holy Book at various times of the day, and it's not like you can easily find someone who is ready and able to hold the Book and help yuo revise.
And even if you find someone, a good Muslim has to avoid "riyaa" (performing good deeds or worshipping to seek admiration from others) and so, that limits the number of people who can help you.
Another problem is that you can revise using a physical Book, but peeking turns out to be a big problem for me.

In this regard, this website was made to help anyone revise by himself.
